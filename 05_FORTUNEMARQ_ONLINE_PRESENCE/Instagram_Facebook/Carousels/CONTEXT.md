## Purpose
Plan and store all carousel post content. Carousels drive saves and shares — best format for educational content and data breakdowns.

- Service explainers (what SEO does, what Google Ads does — for business owners)
- Before/after results (once client results available)
- Tips carousels (5 things local businesses get wrong online)

## Carousel File Format
Each file contains:
- Slide 1: Hook line
- Slides 2–N: Content per slide (heading + body text)
- Final slide: CTA
- Design notes: colours, fonts, layout direction
- Caption + hashtags
