# 04 — Renewals & Upsells
**Last Updated:** March 2026 | **Status:** PENDING — waiting on L6 (reports + health scores) completion

## Purpose
Define when and how to upsell existing clients and manage contract renewals. This is the revenue growth engine — turning ₹2,500/month clients into ₹6,500/month clients over time.

## Depends On
- L6a Monthly Report Templates (results data justifies upsell)
- L6b Client Health Score (score identifies ready clients)
- L3 WhatsApp Templates (message templates for upsell conversations)

## All Upsell Paths
| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| GMB | Google Ads | 50+ calls/month from GMB, 2 months in |
| GMB | Website | No website or poor website, demand proven |
| Google Ads | SEO | 3+ months stable, client asks about long-term |
| Google Ads | Meta Ads | Client wants to expand to Instagram audience |
| Meta Ads | Google Ads | Client misses search-intent customers |
| Website Only | GMB | At go-live moment — retainer pitch |
| Website Only | Google Ads | 2 weeks post go-live, no leads yet |
| SEO Starter | SEO Growth | 3 months, starter keywords ranking |
| SEO Growth | SEO Dominate | 6 months, strong results |
| Any Service | WhatsApp Marketing | Client has customer database |

## Renewal Process
- FMOS alerts Jabeer 30 days before renewal date
- Review client health score
- Prepare renewal + upsell proposal
- Call client — lead with results, pitch upgrade
